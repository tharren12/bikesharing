# Des Moines - Bike Sharing Project

## Overview of Project

Convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. To solidify the proposal a bike trip analysis was undertaken.

For this analysis we used Pandas to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype to order to properly utilize in Tableau.

A number of visualizations were created to utilize the data from NYC bike trips in order to be able to apply to Des Moines.


## Resources

Data Source: NYC_Citibike_Challenge.ipynb and 201908-citibike-tripdata.csv
Data Tools: Jupyter Notebook, CSV, Tableau and IO (Web Server)
