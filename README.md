# Des Moines - Bike Sharing Project

## Overview of Project

Convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. To solidify the proposal a bike trip analysis was undertaken.

For this analysis we used Pandas to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype to order to properly utilize in Tableau.

A number of visualizations were created to utilize the data from NYC bike trips in order to be able to apply to Des Moines.


## Resources

Data Source: NYC_Citibike_Challenge.ipynb and 201908-citibike-tripdata.csv
Data Tools: Jupyter Notebook, CSV, Tableau and IO (Web Server)


## Results

### Time of Trip Duration for Users

![Story1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92001105/152610084-d3151937-0766-4739-8b74-347c5cf0dee9.png)

Most of the users take the bikes out for very short duration trips.

### Time of Trip Duration by Gender

![Story2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92001105/152610143-c77a6807-991a-4a2e-aa0a-66739db4923c.png)

All gender types take bikes for very short durations.

### Trips by Day of the Week and the Hour of Start Time

![Story3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92001105/152610329-27667b24-24e1-4890-a532-7893b2397fae.png)

Weekdays are most popular with users most frequently taking bike trips 7-9am and 5-7pm during the week. Maintenance for the bikes can be scheduled 2-5am.

### Trips by Gender and by Day of the week

![Story4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92001105/152610526-fd8fca14-d809-4501-893b-21e5ef9232b0.png)

Again males are shown to be the most frequent user types and follow a similar trend in days and hours as the overall grouping.

### Trips by User Type, Gender and Day of the Week

![Story5](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92001105/152610752-df9abca2-7037-484a-9c83-bfb28b967fda.png)

The above analysis clearly shows that Subscribers are the most frequent users of the bike service, highlighting the need for a subscription service.

## Summary

As highlighted above the most popular hours will be before work 7-9am and during the week and also from 5-7pm. Maintenance can be done very early in the morning 2-5am.

There are two further analyses that dug into two elements, the first being offering a subscription service, as 80% of the bike trips in NYC were by suscribers so this needs to be offered. The second is the number of trips by gender with Males representing two thirds of the volumes so this also needs to be considered and the local demographics should be understood to ensure in Des Moines that customers will be open to subscriptions and that there is a large share of males in the region.

### Number of Bike Trips by User Type

![Story6](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92001105/152610980-43d9f345-9583-41bb-92bf-8d6a59db63dd.png)

Subscribers are the most significant user type, representing more than 80% of all bike trips.

### Number of Bike Trips by Gender

![Story7](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92001105/152611341-02545153-b825-48dd-9f76-cbb581741b69.png)

Males represent 65% of all bike trips, followed by females whom represent 25%.
